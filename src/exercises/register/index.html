        Well hello there! You seem eager to begin learning JavaScript! Unfortunately, registration is not yet open (can&apos;t have you finishing the course before the first day ;). However, you <em>can</em> read this blurb about how the class is structured:
        </p>
        <p>
        <b>&lt;blurb&gt;</b><br>
        We&apos;ll be using a technique known as &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_learning" target="_blank">active learning</a>.&quot; Woah, woah, hold up, don&apos;t run away <span style="font-size: 60%">yet</span>. If you're skeptical (or traumatized by TEAL), here's the rationale:
        <ol>
          <li>Learning a new programming language requires <em>programming</em> in that language<sup>[citation needed]</sup>.</li>
          <li>There are already plenty of static or semi-interactive tutorials on JS.</li>
        </ol>
        Instead of wasting your time regurgitating (perhaps pre-chewed) tutorials and documentation, I&apos;m going to focus on designing high-quality examples and exercises.
        We&apos;ll work on these during class so that you can take advantage of the full interactivity of a real-life course.
        However, it&apos;ll help if you acquaint yourself with topics covered in each class <em>before class</em>.
        Reading tutorials is boring, so only tasteful links to external resources will be provided for your preparatory pleasure.
        <br><b>&lt;/blurb&gt;</b>
        </p>
        <p>
        So, without further ado, I give you... the suggested readings!

        <h2>Suggested Readings</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="/2014/notes/lecture1_notes.pdf" target="_blank">Introduction to JavaScript - IntroJS 2014</a><br>
            Sections 1, 2 (and <a href="/2014/slides/lecture1_slides.pdf" target="_blank">slide 2</a>), 3 (skim the details), 4.1-2, 4.3 (only first box), 4.4 (read conditionals but skim loops&mdash;you&apos;ll rarely use them)
          </li>
          <li><a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/01_values.html" target="_blank">Values, Types, and Operators - Eloquent JavaScript</a><br>
            Helpful if you have less of a programming background. Covers the same material as above, but gives more of the very basic intuitions.
          </li>
          <li><a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/03_functions.html" target="_blank">Functions - Eloquent JavaScript</a><br>
            Defining a Function, Parameters and Scopes
