      If you haven't already done, so, you'll want to install the Node.js web server application. Navigate to <a href="http://nodejs.org/" target="_blank">nodejs.org</a> and click on the install button. This will download an installer for your platform or the binaries if you're using Linux.
      <ul>
      	<li><span style="font-weight:bold">Linux</span> - move the binary files into the correct locations (the folder names give you this info)</li>
      	<li><span style="font-weight:bold">Macintosh &amp; Windows</span> - run the installer</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Warm Up</h2>
  	<ol class="assignment">
      <span class="topic">[Node.js]</span>
      <li class="question">
      Verify that your install worked by making your own "Hello world" server!
      <br>
      Open the command line and use the <pre inline>cd</pre> command to navigate to your server's JS file and execute <pre inline>node yourfile.js</pre>. Your server should start serving your website at <a href="http://localhost" target="_blank">localhost:yourPortNumber</a>
      </li>
  	</ol>

    <h2>Practice problems</h2>
    <ol class="assignment">
    	<span class="topic">[Forms, WebSockets]</span>
    	<li class="question">
    	Use socket.io to create a real-time, push chat server. You can use <a href="assignment5_resources/chat-server.js" target="_blank">this</a> starter Node.js file and <a href="assignment5_resources/chat-client.html" target="_blank">this</a> starter HTML file.
    	<br>
    	Simple, for this question, means that the user should have some way of setting their username and sending a chat message to the chat room. Connected users should receive messages from other users basically as soon as they're posted.
    	<br>
    	This question should be easy to self-check, but since there is no checker, solutions will be posted.
    	</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Challenge problems</h2>
    <ol class="assignment">
      <span class="topic">[REST API (Express, routes), AJAX]</span>
      <li class="question">
      	Download <a href="assignment5_resources/people.js" target="_blank">this</a> file to your current Node.js workspace (wherever you've installed Express) and import it into your project using <pre inline>var people = require("./people.js")</pre>. This will provide a JS Array of Person Objects (I know how much you like these) as the <pre inline>people</pre> variable.
      	<br>
      	Do the same thing that you did for <a href="http://introjsiap.com/assignments/lecture3_assignment.html" target="_blank">Assignment 3 - Practice Problem 2</a> except you should retreive the Person's information from a webserver that you create. You should use AJAX to GET this data from the server.
      	<br>
      	Don't forget to import the checker (and set the title of the page to Assignment 5 - Challenge Problem #1)
